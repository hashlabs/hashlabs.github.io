    title: "Roadmapping"
    content: "We start every project with one or two weeks of planning where we layout the work we need to do and estimate how much time it will take. Also, we start with the initial mockups and flows for the application before writing the first line of code.<br/><br/>The goal of this phase is to have a clear sense of what success means for this project and have everyone (both our team and our clients) with that clear idea on mind."
