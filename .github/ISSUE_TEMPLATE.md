# Context

As our project covers multiple parts, this is how we designate where the issue lives. (i.e. microservice-x, microservice-y, activity-a, activity-b... etc). Try to be specific in order to your teammates to address the issue quickly. If the issue belongs to a suggestions just point where this suggestion is going to take part.

## Acceptance Criteria

* First thing
* Second thing

# Environment

If the issues address a situation that needs to be solved and no a suggestion, specify where this problem has been reproduced (staging, production, device version, OS... etc)
